# Roadmap

## Phase 1 — Data foundation

The app is only as good as its data. Before any UI, establish the schema and seed the core corpus.

### 1.1 Schema

Design the core data model:

- [x] `corpus` — top-level grouping (e.g. "Bible", "Quran", "Pali Canon")
- [x] `tradition` — religious tradition (Christian, Islamic, Buddhist, etc.)
- [x] `scripture` — a named text within a corpus (e.g. "Genesis", "Surah Al-Fatiha")
- [x] `division` — recursive self-referential model for chapters, books, parts, cantos, etc.
- [x] `passage` — the atomic unit of text (verse, stanza, line, section)
- [x] `translation` — a named version of a corpus in a given language (e.g. "KJV", "Yusuf Ali")
- [x] `passage_translation` — the translated text of a passage in a given translation
- [x] `original_language_token` — tokenized word from the original language text, linked to a passage
- [x] `lexicon_entry` — definition and morphology for a token (Hebrew, Greek, Arabic, Sanskrit, etc.)
- [x] `manuscript` — a named manuscript or textual witness (e.g. Codex Sinaiticus, Dead Sea Scroll 1QIsa)
- [x] `textual_variant` — a variant reading at a specific passage across manuscripts
- [x] `source_document` — hypothetical or identified source layers (e.g. J, E, D, P; Q source; deutero-Isaiah)
- [x] `composition_date` — scholarly dating with range, confidence, and citation (e.g. "7th c. BCE, likely exilic")
- [x] `parallel_passage` — cross-tradition intertextual links (e.g. Genesis flood ↔ Gilgamesh XI ↔ Quran 11:25–48)

### 1.2 Source data

Prioritise critical editions and scholarly sources over devotional translations.

**Cross-tradition tasks**
- [ ] Identify reliable public domain sources for each corpus listed in the README
- [ ] Prefer critical editions with manuscript notes over popular devotional editions
- [x] Write an importer rake task per source format — bible_json, bible_wlc, quran_tanzil, sblgnt, strongs, suttacentral, hadith, tafsir, sira, ibn_kathir_sira, fiqh, manuscripts, mesopotamian, mesopotamian_original, celtic, norse, lebor_gabala_english, dss_translation, transliterate
- [x] Latin-script transliteration service for Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic (`Transliterate` module + `Import::Transliteration`); SBLGNT-T, WLC-T, QAR-T, and per-scroll DSS-T translations are generated by `rake import:transliterate`

### 1.3 Import pipeline

- [x] Build `rake import:*` tasks for each source format (OSIS, USFM, JSON, plain text) — `import:bible_json`, `import:quran_tanzil`, `import:download`, `import:all`
- [x] Normalize all passage references into a canonical `corpus:division:passage` URI scheme
- [x] Validate import completeness with checksums and passage counts

- [x] Highlight structural differences between versions (missing verses, alternate orderings, textual variants) — amber border for missing verses, purple "V" indicator for textual variants

### 3.5 Translation diff

- [x] Word-level diff between any two translations of the same passage — `?diff=1`
- [x] Highlight additions, deletions, and substitutions — red strikethrough for deletions, green for additions
- [x] Use a diffing library (e.g. `diff-lcs`) applied to tokenized passage text

---

## Phase 4 — Organization

- [x] Six predefined colours, user-labelled — yellow, blue, green, pink, purple, orange
- [x] Highlights persist per user per passage translation

### 4.3 Annotations

- [x] Attach a rich-text note to any passage — inline form via Stimulus, displayed under passage
- [x] Tags: user-defined, autocompleted — comma-separated tag_list with auto-creation

- [x] Share collections publicly or keep private — `public` boolean, public collections viewable without auth

---

## Phase 5 — Study tools

### 5.1 Intertextual links & cross-tradition parallels

- [x] Prompt includes original text, source language, surrounding context, and style instruction
- [x] Generated translations stored in the database and served like any other translation
- [x] Users can rate and annotate LLM translations — Rating model (1-5 score per user per passage translation), annotations already work on any passage

- [x] Enable HTTP caching headers for public (unauthenticated) passage views — `expires_in 1.hour, public: true` with ETag/Last-Modified for guests
- [x] Use Solid Cache for fragment caching of expensive views (commentary, cross-refs) — `cache` blocks on all four study sidebar panels (sources, variants, parallels, commentary) keyed by division
- [x] Benchmark and tune FTS queries against full corpus size — switched from manual `to_tsquery` to `websearch_to_tsquery` for natural language search, quoted phrases, and exclusion support; removed redundant sanitization
