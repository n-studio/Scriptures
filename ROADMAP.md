# Roadmap

## Phase 1 — Data foundation

The app is only as good as its data. Before any UI, establish the schema and seed the core corpus.

### 1.1 Schema

Design the core data model:

- [x] `corpus` — top-level grouping (e.g. "Bible", "Quran", "Pali Canon")
- [x] `tradition` — religious tradition (Christian, Islamic, Buddhist, etc.)
- [x] `scripture` — a named text within a corpus (e.g. "Genesis", "Surah Al-Fatiha")
- [x] `division` — recursive self-referential model for chapters, books, parts, cantos, etc.
- [x] `passage` — the atomic unit of text (verse, stanza, line, section)
- [x] `translation` — a named version of a corpus in a given language (e.g. "KJV", "Yusuf Ali")
- [x] `passage_translation` — the translated text of a passage in a given translation
- [x] `original_language_token` — tokenized word from the original language text, linked to a passage
- [x] `lexicon_entry` — definition and morphology for a token (Hebrew, Greek, Arabic, Sanskrit, etc.)
- [x] `manuscript` — a named manuscript or textual witness (e.g. Codex Sinaiticus, Dead Sea Scroll 1QIsa)
- [x] `textual_variant` — a variant reading at a specific passage across manuscripts
- [x] `source_document` — hypothetical or identified source layers (e.g. J, E, D, P; Q source; deutero-Isaiah)
- [x] `composition_date` — scholarly dating with range, confidence, and citation (e.g. "7th c. BCE, likely exilic")
- [x] `parallel_passage` — cross-tradition intertextual links (e.g. Genesis flood ↔ Gilgamesh XI ↔ Quran 11:25–48)

### 1.2 Source data

Prioritise critical editions and scholarly sources over devotional translations:

**Bible**
- [ ] OSIS or USFM XML sources (e.g. eBible.org, Crosswire)
- [x] Translations: KJV, ASV, YLT, Darby (public domain) — all 4 imported via scrollmapper JSON (~31,100 verses each)
- [ ] WEB (World English Bible) — not available in scrollmapper, needs alternate source
- [ ] Critical translations: NRSV, NJPS (license permitting)
- [x] Original languages: SBLGNT (Greek NT, 7,927 verses from MorphGNT)
- [ ] Original languages: Westminster Leningrad Codex (Hebrew), LXX (Septuagint)
- [x] Strongs lexicon (Hebrew & Greek) — 8,674 Hebrew + 5,523 Greek entries from OpenScriptures
- [x] Dead Sea Scrolls (public domain transcriptions) — 266 manuscripts, 11,711 passage variants from BiblicalDSS (CC BY-NC 4.0)
- [ ] Codex Sinaiticus and Vaticanus (digitised, public domain)

**Quran**
- [x] Tanzil.net source (Arabic + translations) — Arabic, Sahih International, Yusuf Ali, Pickthall (6,236 ayahs each)
- [x] Translations: Yusuf Ali, Pickthall, Sahih International — all three imported
- [ ] Sana'a manuscript variants (earliest extant Quran fragments)

**Pali Canon**
- [x] SuttaCentral data (JSON) — Dhammapada imported (423 verses, Pali + Bhikkhu Sujato English)

**Other traditions**
- [ ] Identify reliable public domain sources for each corpus listed in the README
- [ ] Prefer critical editions with manuscript notes over popular devotional editions
- [x] Write an importer rake task per source format — bible_json, quran_tanzil, sblgnt, strongs, suttacentral

### 1.3 Import pipeline

- [x] Build `rake import:*` tasks for each source format (OSIS, USFM, JSON, plain text) — `import:bible_json`, `import:quran_tanzil`, `import:download`, `import:all`
- [x] Normalize all passage references into a canonical `corpus:division:passage` URI scheme
- [x] Validate import completeness with checksums and passage counts
- [x] Store raw source files in `db/seeds/sources/` under version control or object storage — gitignored, downloaded on demand via `rake import:download`

---

## Phase 2 — Authentication & accounts

- [x] Magic link login — enter email, receive a one-time sign-in link
- [x] Passkey support — register and authenticate via WebAuthn (Face ID, Touch ID, hardware keys)
- [x] Account settings (display name, default corpus, default translation, language)
- [x] Guest mode — read-only access without an account

---

## Phase 3 — Core reading experience

### 3.1 Navigation

- [x] Add passages to collections from the reading view — dropdown menu on passage hover
- [x] Share collections publicly or keep private — `public` boolean, public collections viewable without auth

---

## Phase 5 — Study tools

### 5.1 Intertextual links & cross-tradition parallels

- [x] Seed a dataset of intertextual relationships between passages across traditions — ParallelPassage model with 5 relationship types, seeded data pending corpus growth
- [x] Display linked passages inline in the reading view — Parallels tab in study sidebar with links to target passages
- [x] Distinguish link types: literary dependence, shared source, allusion, typology, quotation — colour-coded badges
- [x] Allow users to add their own intertextual links with a relationship type and citation — ParallelPassagesController with optional user_id

### 5.2 Source criticism

- [x] Colour-code passages by source document where scholarly consensus exists (J/E/D/P for Torah, Q/M/L/Mark for Gospels, deutero- and trito-Isaiah, etc.) — primary text coloured by source

- [x] Clearly distinguish critical scholarship from devotional commentary; label each accordingly — type badges
- [x] Display alongside the passage, collapsible — Commentary tab in study sidebar
- [x] Link commentary paragraphs to specific passages
- [ ] Import public domain critical commentaries (ICC, Cambridge Bible, etc.) — model ready, awaiting digitised source data

### 5.6 LLM translations

Generated by admins only — translations are produced in bulk and stored, not generated on demand by users.

- [x] Integrate Claude API (or configurable provider) — LlmTranslationJob with Anthropic API
- [x] Admin interface to generate translations for a passage range or entire corpus — `rake llm:translate[corpus,scripture,style,from,to]`
  - [x] **Word for word** — precise word-for-word rendering from the original language
  - [x] **Easy read** — accessible modern prose rendering
  - [x] **Summary paraphrase** — condensed rendering
- [x] Both modes prompt the model with: original text, source language, historical context, authorial intent, and an explicit non-devotional, atheist-scholarly perspective
- [x] Prompt includes original text, source language, surrounding context, and style instruction
- [x] Generated translations stored in the database and served like any other translation
- [x] Users can rate and annotate LLM translations — Rating model (1-5 score per user per passage translation), annotations already work on any passage

---

## Phase 6 — Search

### 6.1 Full-text search

- [x] PostgreSQL full-text search (tsvector/tsquery) over all passage translations — GIN-indexed tsvector column with auto-updating trigger

- [x] Useful for finding all uses of a Greek or Hebrew word regardless of how it was translated

---

## Phase 7 — Research tools

- [x] **Research curricula** — structured reading sequences modelled on academic syllabi (e.g. "Introduction to the Hebrew Bible", "NT source criticism", "Comparative flood narratives", "Early Islamic texts") — Curriculum model with types (introduction, source_criticism, comparative, thematic, custom), CRUD UI, public/private visibility
- [x] Custom reading sequences: user defines an ordered list of passages for a research project — CurriculumItem model with position, title, and notes; add passages from reading view; drag-to-reorder via Stimulus controller
- [x] Progress tracking: passages read, percentage complete, reading history — ReadingProgress model, progress bar on curriculum show/index, mark read/unread toggles, per-passage read status in reading view
